# CS-305

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements.
Artemis Financial is a company that provides financial services and needed help identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in their software systems. Their main concern was improving their software’s security practices and protecting client data from potential risks. They wanted a full vulnerability assessment and recommendations for secure coding practices.

# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely?
I did a good job identifying vulnerabilities that could cause serious security risks, such as hardcoded credentials and missing input validation. It’s important to code securely because it protects sensitive data, maintains customer trust, and helps the company avoid costly breaches or legal problems.

# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
One challenge was manually reviewing the code line-by-line to find hidden risks. However, it was also helpful because it made me more aware of how small mistakes, like missing input checks, can become big problems.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by adding input validation, avoiding insecure dependencies, and improving error handling. In the future, I would use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, static code analyzers, and manual code reviews to find vulnerabilities and choose the right mitigation strategies.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check for new vulnerabilities?
I tested the code after making changes to make sure it still worked correctly. I also re-ran security tools and reviewed the updated code to double-check that no new vulnerabilities were introduced during refactoring.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and researched secure coding guidelines. These tools and practices will definitely help in future projects where security is a major priority.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show future employers the vulnerability assessment report or the secure coding practices report. It proves that I can spot real-world security issues, fix them properly, and write professional reports explaining the work and improvements.
